# Ethical Hacking
**CEH Exam Notes**

## Overview of Ethics

As part of the code of ethics, you will be sworn to keep information you obtain as part of your work private, paying particular attention to protecting the information and intellectual property of employers and clients. 

You are expected to disclose information that needs to be disclosed to the people whp have engaged your services. You are also expected to disclose potential conflicts of interest.

The first-time responsible disclosure was identified and documented in the 1990s. The security researcher Rain Forest Puppy developed a full disclosure policy, sometimes called the Rain Forest Puppy Policy (RFP or RFPolicy).

Another responsible disclosure took place in mid-2000s by Dan Kaminsky. He found serious flaws in the implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS), which impacts everyone on the internet. He worked with vendors to make sure they had time to fix their services before disclosing the information publicly.

As you perform work, you will be given access to resourced provided by the client or company. Under the EC-Council code of ethics, you will need to agree to, you cannot misue any of the equipment. You cant damage anything you have access to as part of your employment or contact. 

Perhaps it goes without saying, but you are not allowed to engage in any illegal actions during penetration testing. Similarly, you cannot have been convicted of any felony. Along the same lines, though its not directly illegal, you cant be involved with any group that may be considered “black hat”, meaning they are engaged in potentially illegal activities. 

Communication is also important when you embark on an engagement, regardless of whether you are working on contract or are a full-time employee.

# Overview of Ethical Hacking

Fun fact: Mirai botnet, which infected smaller, special-purpose devices running an embedded implementation of Linux, is believed to consist of well over 100k bots with the possibility being more than one million. 

Since 2005, there has not been a year without at least 10 million data records being compromised. In 2017, nearly 200 million records were compromised just from the United States alone. 

One of the challenges of ethical hacking is to think like an attacker. Testing of this nature is often challenging and requires a different way of thinking. When doing any sort of testing, including ethical hacking, a methodology is important, as it helps to ensure that your actions are both repeatable and verifiable. 

EC-Council helps to ensure that this work is done ethically by requiring anyone who has obtained Certified Ethical Hacker certifications agree to this code of conduct.

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or red teaming, is an act of lcoatting the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of computer and information systems by duplicating the intent and actions of malicious hackers. Its all about ferreting out the problems to improve overall security posture of the target. An ethical hacker is a security professional who applies their hacking skills for defensive purposes on behalf of the owners of information systems. Ethical hackers are among the most sought-after information security employees in large organizations.
